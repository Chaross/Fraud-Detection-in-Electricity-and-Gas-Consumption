# Fraud-Detection-in-Energy-and-Gas-Consumption
Fraud Detection is one the most common Machine Leanirng Case Study leveraged by Consumer and Financial services Companies to undertsand customer/consumer behaviour and to prevent theft and fraudulent activities using historical data. It is widely used in Banks and Electricity companies to detect fraud in transactions.

This project is aimed at using Invoice and Client Data to train a machine Learning Model that classifies consumers based on their likelihood of commiting fraud. The two datasets were split into training and test sets. The invoice data has been split to roughly 20% in the test set and 80% in the test set. While the client dataset has been split into 70% for the train set and 30% for the test set.
